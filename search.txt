Docker uses an HTTP-based REST API to communicate between the Docker client and the Docker daemon, usually over a Unix socket, and optionally over TCP.
we can send a http request to the socket using curl to see the running container => curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/containers/json

containerd :  (pronounced container-dee). Its sole purpose in life was to manage container lifecycle operations — start | stop | pause | rm....

run : runc has a single purpose in life — create containers. And it’s damn good at it.
