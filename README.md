#### What is Docker ?

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

#### What is Docker Engine ?

Docker Engine is an open source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. Docker Engine acts as a client-server application with:

- A server with a long-running daemon process dockerd.
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client docker.

## Commands:

`docker container ls`

- Shows only running containers

`docker container ls -l`

- -l = last created container

`docker container ls -a or -la`

- -a = all containers (running or stopped)
